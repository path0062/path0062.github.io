            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </article>
           <p>Hello! I'm Rakhi, originally from India and currently living in Canada with my husband and 7-year-old daughter. Alongside my role as a mom and homemaker, I'm a full-time content creator managing two YouTube channels and a website. On my website <em>WOD<sup>[1]</sup></em>, I share digital resources for kids' learning. I started creating online content five years ago with very basic knowledge. </p>
           <p>I've learned a lot about content creation in the past few years, and I've realized that if I want to turn content creation into my full-time career, I need to upgrade my skills. That's the main reason I chose the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course. It covers everything I need to learn, including photography, filming, illustration, web design, and development. I'm hopeful that by the end of this course, I'll have the necessary skills to pursue a career in content creation or a similar niche. </p>
           <p>Being a parent, I live by this quote:
            <blockquote>
              "What we are teaches the child far more than what we say, so we must be what we want our children to become." -
              <cite>Joseph Chilton Pearce</cite>
